        <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
        <p>
          Zone 6 born and raised, so Omeretta the Great is not excluding me.
          Growing up so deep in the city allowed me to see all sides of Atlanta,
          and meet all of its different people. A city in the trees, and a
          populous so diverse, it is impossible not to fall in love. After
          graduating from Grady High School
          <em>(now known as Midtown High)</em> I joined the Georgia Army
          National Guard to assist in paying for college at the University of
          North Georgia. I received a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice
          and a Paralegal Certificate from the University of Georgia. Following
          a short stint in Savannah, I returned to the city I love, and push for
          a better tomorrow.

          Presently a student through the
          <a href="https://vetswhocode.io/" target="_blank">Vets Who Code</a>
          program. This bootcamp has provided me strong knowledge of GitHub,
          HTML, and CSS. Pushing forward, I will be diving deep into React,
          Gatsby and Javascript.

          Although my initial plan was to work in the legal field, as many
          mid-twenties and older people know, things don't always go according
          to plan. After five years in the legal field I decided it was time to
          move on. It was not what I expected, and not an environment I
          personally thrive in. I learned more than I thought was possible, and
          met many amazing people, but it was not something I could see long
          term. Tech has always been an interest of mine, and after talking over
          with friends who are on all different sides from UX to Back End, it
          was time for me to make the jump to something that truly interested
          me, and pushed me to learn more and practice.
